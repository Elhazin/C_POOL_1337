[C language](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_overview.htm) is a low-level language that offers various features such as [conditions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_decision_making.htm) and [loops ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_loops.htm). \
It allows programmers to work with [variables](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_variables.php) and utilize concepts like [pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm). Additionally, C supports the use of [functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm) and enables [recursion](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_recursion.htm).\
Understanding the distinction between [pass by value and pass by reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-call-by-value-and-call-by-reference/) is crucial. C also provides powerful capabilities for handling [arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm) and working with [strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm).\
To comprehend the dissimilarity between a [string and an array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1704407/what-is-the-difference-between-a-string-and-an-array-of-characters) as well as [pointer and array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-pointer-array-c/), clear understanding is required. Moreover, it is essential to grasp the concept of [data types in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_data_types.htm).\
Exploring a [shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q) in C can offer additional functionalities. Lastly, understanding [the difference between a constant and a variable](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_constants.htm) is fundamental for effective programming.
